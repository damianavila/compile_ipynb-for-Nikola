IPython Development Workflow

# Get a read only copy of the "master"
git clone git://github.com/ipython/nbconvert.git

# Add a copy of the master to your github account
git remote add ocefpaf git@github.com:ocefpaf/nbconvert.git

# Start a new branch to work on
git checkout -b your_new_branch

# Push updates to your local branch to your github branch
git push --set-upstream ocefpaf math_test:math_test

( merging your updated github branch into the master is done via pull-request on the website)

# Delete local branch
git branch -d math_test

# Delete remote branch
git push ocefpaf :math_test
